# INF 8215: Devoir 2
Second project for the cours INF8215 (AI Algorithms)

## Environment
Minizinc software [Download](https://www.minizinc.org/software.html)

## Project Progression
### Problem 0: Introduction
- [x] Done

### Problem 1: Easy Level
- [x] Problem
- [ ] Have only 1 output

### Problem 2: Normal Level
- [x] Done

### Problem 3: Hard Level
- [x] Done
- [ ] Additional optimization checks

### Problem 4: *Extreme* Level 
- [x] Done
- [ ] Heavy optimisation
The problem takes a very long time to run for data 0 and 2 (resp 7s and 1mn), something must be optimised
Or maybe ask if the runtime is to be expected?
